SETUP
- Clone this repository
- Disable Antivirus if you prefer speed of installation.
- Download cygwin 'setup.exe' here.
- Open DOS Command Prompt and run cygwinsetup.bat
- If you are on windows run init.bat in ADMINISTRATOR mode command prompt. (This guy creates the hard links to the dotfiles directory. Ex: from .bashrc to dotfiles/.bashrc, changes shell and fixes home directory in /etc/passwd etc)
- Setup mintty shortcut
- Then open up cygwin, navigate here and run setup.zsh
- Modify gitenv-sap, gitenv-hub with your git environment setup
- Before doing GIT development run the shell function gitenv-hub() or gitenv-sap(). This will
source the relevant git file.
- That's all for now.
TIPS
- CD automatically pushes directory onto stack
- You can use cd - to toggle between first two directories on stack
- You can use cd [+-]N to move to Nth directory on stack (from top or bottom)
- You can define mydir=<path> and use cd mydir to jump to mydir. To get automcomplete of named directories you can cd ~my<TAB> and list all your named directories starting with my.
- Use dirs or dv (alias) to list directories on stack.
